# Basic_Lane_Line_Detection
Detection of lane lines using basic computer vision techniques.

Steps:
1. Read input image
2. Covert to grayscale
3. Apply gaussian blur
4. Apply canny edge detection
5. Apply polygonal mask
6. Detect hough lines
7. Segregate points belonging to left and right lane lines
8. Fit left and right lines using regression
9. Draw lane lines
